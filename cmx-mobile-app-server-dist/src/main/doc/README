                      CMX Mobile Application Server

Overview 
--------
   The CMX mobile application server receives location updates, setup, and configuration information  
   from the Connect and Engage system. It serves the requests from Software Development Kit (SDK)  
   clients for location information, point of interests, zones, and floors.  

CMX Mobile Application Server Installation 
------------------------------------------
   The CMX Mobile Application Server is distributed as an RPM that can be installed on the latest Redhat  
   or Fedora Linux servers. The installation is done using the RPM install command. 

   Step 1   If you are installing the CMX Mobile Application Server for the first time, use the following command: 
               rpm -iv cmx-mobile-app-server-version.x86_64.rpm

            The CMX Mobile Application Server is installed in the /opt/cmx-mobile-app-server directory. 
            If you are upgrading the existing CMX Mobile Application Server, use the following command: 
               rpm -Uvf cmx-mobile-app-server-version.x86_64.rpm

   Step 2   Run the below setup script to configure a new installation:  
               /opt/cmx-mobile-app-server/setup/setup.sh 

                [Configuring the CMX Mobile Application Server starts] 
                Configure CMX Mobile App Server:

                1) Display current configuration   5) SDK Server port
                2) Communication credentials *     6) Log level
                3) SDK credentials                 7) ## Verify and apply changes ##
                4) Server port

                Please enter your choice [1 - 7]:

   Step 3   Configure the communication credentials:

                Please enter your choice [1-7]: 2 

                Enter an admin username. 
                The admin user is used to authenticate MSE configuration data. Once this  
                password is updated, it must correspondingly be updated on the MSE UI  
                page for Mobile App Enablement Parameters so that the MSE can  
                communicate with the server. 

                Enter a communication username: admin 

                Enter a password for the admin user. 
                The admin user is used to authenticate MSE configuration data. Once this  
                password is updated, it must correspondingly be updated on the MSE UI  
                page for Mobile App Enablemet Parameters so that the MSE can communicate  
                with the server. 

                Enter communication password: 
                Confirm communication password:

   Step 4   Verify the setup information and apply changes: 

                Please enter your choice [1-7]: 7 

                Please verify the following setup information. 
                ------------------------------------BEGIN------------------------------- 

                    Communication username changed 
                    Communication password changed 

                -------------------------------------End-------------------------------- 

                You may enter “yes” to proceed with configuration, “no” to make more  
                changes. 

                Configuration changed 
                Is the above information correct (yes or no): yes

                        floors, zones, and points of interest. If a zone was configured for a floor,
                        the command shows the zone name and some information about the zone. The  
                        same for point of interest defined on a floor. Running this command will allow
                        the user to verify the configurations done in Connect and Engage are showing up 
                        on the server. 

      "getServerStats.sh"
                        Displays wireless client counts, notification event counts, mobile application usage
                        statistics, mobile push notification statistics, and configuration update statistics.  
                        Each statistic shows a running count, the last updated time, and count per second. 
                        This can be used to determine if the push notifications are being sent to the server.
                        By checking the last updated time or running count, a user can get an idea if the server
                        is being properly updated or not.
